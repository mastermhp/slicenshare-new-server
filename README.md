## Environment Variables

Before you start the application, you need to set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

### Explanation of Environment Variables

- **MONGO_USERNAME**: Your MongoDB username.
- **MONGO_PASSWORD**: Your MongoDB password.
- **MONGO_CLUSTER**: The MongoDB cluster URL. This typically looks like `cluster0.mongodb.net`.
- **MONGO_DB_NAME**: The name of the database you want to connect to.
- **PORT**: The port on which the server will run (default is `4200`).
- **BASE_URL**: The base URL for the API. You can set this to `http://localhost:4200/api/v1` during development.

After you’ve created the .env file with the correct values, you’re ready to start the application.# slicenshare-new-server
